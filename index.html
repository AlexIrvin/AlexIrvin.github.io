            <li class="column"><h1>American Styles</h1>
                <h2>Rye</h2>
                    <p>
                        Rye whiskey must be at least 51% rye, containing no additives beyond grain and water, aged in new, charred oak containers, and distilled to no more than 160 proof, and entered into the barrel at no more than 125 proof. Rye whiskeys can often be characterized by their spice-forward flavor profiles with secondary notes of mint and floral undertones. Rye whiskey has the distinctive bitter bite of rye bread that carries over through distillation, imparting an almost hot mouthfeel. Coupled with notes of cinnamon, cloves, and caraway, Ryes are a unique class of their own. 
                    </p>
                <h2>Bourbon</h2>
                    <p>
                        Similar to rye whiskey, bourbon must be at least 51% corn, also containing no additives beyond grain and water, aged in new, charred oak containers, and distilled to no more than 160 proof, and entered into the barrel at no more than 125 proof. The unique piece for bourbon, is that as of 1964, bourbon is classified as a distinctive spirit of America, requiring it to be produced in the United States to be labeled as such. Bourbon whiskeys are typically flavored with secondary grains such as rye and wheat to create unique mash bills and flavor profiles. High rye bourbons typically impart notes of mint, cloves, and baking spices, where high wheat bourbons typically have a more mellow, cereal grain-forward flavor with a soft, rich mouthfeel. Some bourbons use malted barley as a flavoring grain, which can lead to interesting parallels and softer counterparts to scotch whiskies. 
                    </p>
                <h2>Tennessee Whiskey</h2>
                    <p>
                        Tennessee whiskey, made in a very similar way to bourbon, undergoes one additional process that separates it. Charcoal filtration is a process that removes flavor impurities from whiskey, which has come to be known as the "Lincoln County Method". This process is reductive, rather than additive to the whiskey, so theoretically Tennessee Whiskey's could be classified as bourbons, but both proponents and their counterparts argue that these products should be identified separately.

            <li class="column"><h1>European Styles</h1>
                <h2>Scotch</h2>
                    <p>
                        Scotch whisky, as you can probably imagine, is a distilled spirit produced only in Scotland, per its agreed upon "Standards of Identity." Scotch can be produced with malted barley, grain, or a combination of the two. Scotch must be aged in oak barrels (normally used bourbon barrels) for no less than 3 years, must be distilled to no more than 190 proof, and bottled at no less than 80 proof. Scotch barrels must be no larger than 700 liters (185 US Gallons), and cannot contain any additives other than water and plain caramel coloring.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Speyside</h3>
                        <p>Scotch distilled in the Speyside region of Scotland takes on the characteristics of the local climate and terrain. Whisky from this region usually takes on a rich, sweet flavor profile with grassy notes, underlined with apple, vanilla, and oak. The Speyside region accounts for more than 60% of Scotland's single malt whisky output.</p>
                    <h3>Highlands</h3>
                        <p>Stretching across the largest geographical proportion of Scotland, Highlands Scotches can carry a variety of flavor profiles. Most notably, bready, fruity notes accompanying a definitive malted taste profile distinguish the category.</p>
                    <h3>Lowlands</h3>
                        <p>Lowland Scotches are predominantly grain-based and produced in blended Scotches on a mass-production scale, but a subset of distillers still produce a light, grassy, single malt that can be noted for its honeysuckle and toffee notes.  </p>
                    <h3>Islay</h3>
                        <p>Islay Scotches contain the most well-known flavor profiles for Scotch because of their use of peat in the production process. Peat is made up of decomposed vegetable matter normally found in bogs, swamps, etc. This material burns incredibly well, which led to its rise in use across Scotland as an easily avaiable fuel source. When burned, the peat gives off a strong, thick smoke that imparts a distinctive flavor. By burning it underneath barley grains during the malting process, that flavor profile carries all the way through distillation and aging. This imparts notes of brine, seaweed, and smoke that make up the primary flavors of Islay Scotches.</p>
                    <h3>Campbeltown</h3>
                        <p>A smaller region on the southern tip of Scotland; Campbeltown is known for producing both peat-forward scotches and mild grassy scotches. Once a large hub for Scotch in the early 1800s, only three distilleries remain today. These three produce vastly different styles, and give an excellent opportunity to get wide exposure to the breadth of Scotch flavors.</p>

                <h2>Irish</h2>
                    <p>
                        Similar to Scotch, Irish whiskeys must also be aged a minimum of three years in barrels. New barrels are occasionally used, but oftentimes, used sherry, rum, and bourbon barrels are utilized for aging. Flavor-wise, these whiskeys are often light and fruit-forward, with hints of cereal grains. The bright favor profile for these whiskeys can be attributed to both the higher proof (sometimes bottled as high as 60% ABV), and younger age profile versus popular single malt scotches.

            <li class="column"><h1>Canadian Whisky</h1>
                <p>
                    Canadian whisky has an interesting and storied past, owing its rise to fame to the American Prohibition. During the period of 1920-1933, when alcohol could not be purchased for consumption in the United States, Candadian whisky was brought in illegally to be sold secretly by criminal organizations like that of Al Capone's. Due to its hardy nature, rye grains rose in popularity for whisky production very quicky through harsh Canadian winters, leading to the prevalence of rye being the predominant flavoring grain in Canadian whiskies. Required to be produced in Canada, these whiskeys must be aged in "small wood" (barrels) for no less than three years containing no less than 40% alcohol by volume. Interestingly, Canadian whiskies are often distilled at higher proofs, leading to lighter flavor profiles being common, but Canada allows for the use of coloring and flavorings in whiskeys, creating more diversity amongst whisky brands. Popular tasting notes include toffee, cinnamon, and toasted cereal grain notes.

            <li class="column"><h1>Japanese Whisky</h1>
                <p>
                    Japanese Whiskies have only come to be within the last century. Masataka Taketsuru, a Japanese businessman traveled to Scotland in 1918, where he toured the country, explored the world of scotches, and took a five day distilling course. Bringing this knowledge back, and partnering with Shinjiro Torii in 1921, Yamazaki whisky was created. Around 100 years later, 7 major distilleries exist, producing a variety of styles that mirror scotch in style, but carrying unique flavor profiles due to differences in geography and production techniques. As a burgeoning whisky style, Japanese whiskies are gaining prevalence around the world and finding market share in the premium to super-premium space in the American market. Uniquely, Japanes whiskies tend to take on a honeysuckle flavor profile, with hints of toffee and oranges.
