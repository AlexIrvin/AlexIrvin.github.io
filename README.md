Code Louisville Project Information:

This project is designed to be an interactive walkthrough of different whiskeys around the world, and their characteristics.
The scope of this website is three web pages:
  1. A home page including a description of each whiskey/whisky and the major subcategories associated with Scotch Whisky.
  2. A Whisk(e)y Overview page, detailing the tasting notes and major standards of identity for each style.
  3. An interactive quiz that tallies user answers to tie their preferences to a certain whiskey flavor profile.
  
  Chosen Project Features:
  1. A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu (such as a “hamburger” menu) 
    Found on every page.
  2. Use media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout 
    Seen on Home Page.
  3. Use JavaScript to perform math operations and display the result on your site
    Seen on Quiz page. Each quiz question answer iterates an associated variable, and a combination of those variables results in a quiz result through a nested if statement.
  4. Create a JavaScript function whose return value is used in your site. The function must be triggered by user action (ex: clicking a button).
    Seen on Quiz page. Final quiz answer returns whisk(e)y value based on variable values.
